# Tic-Tac-Checkers
A strategy game combining Tic-Tac-Toe's focus on creating a pattern with Chinese Checkers' focus on maneuvering pieces into specific positions.


## What am I making?

I would like to make a strategy game. 

 

## Details?

This would obviously be a web application. I am envisioning something akin to a cross between Tic-Tac-Toe and Chinese Checkers. It would be a 2-player game, with players taking turns moving their pieces across a board. They can jump over the other player's pieces, but this will not remove them. It will simply be a means of moving pieces. By arranging their pieces into a certain pattern, it would grant that player a point. The first player to arrange their pieces into three different patterns wins.

 

## Conclusion?

This is unlikely to be groundbreaking, but I at least hope for it to be somewhat original and enjoyable.
